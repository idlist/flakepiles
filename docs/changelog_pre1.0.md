# Changelog (pre 1.0)

## 0.1.4

- When finish editing, jump to the flake just edited when finish editing (so that the flake is still trackable when reflow happens).
- Adjusted the style of lists in rendered markdown. Disabled the toggling behavior of task items (`- []`) as it is not meant to be live editable.
- Added "New flakepile" command to command palette. (#1)
